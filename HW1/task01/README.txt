The variable "lotto" is the key which should be use as the argument for
predict_rand binary to print flag.txt.

To get the lotto, I wrote a script, use code from predict_rand.c to
generate same lotto

The script name is "lotto", its source code lotto.c can be found in
this dir

Then I run:
./predict_rand $(./lotto)
and get the flag:
