1. check defence mechanism
    checksec binary_name
        arch: 32 bit
            possible for NOP sled
        Stack: no canary
            possible for buffer overflow
        NX: disable
            possible for execute shellcode on buffer
        RELRO: partial
            GOT is writable
        PIE: NO
            binary ASLR is disable
        PIE: YES
            return address unknown   

2. check Attack methods
    buffer overflow
    GOT table Attack
    NOP sled
    Gadget

3. consider the binary itself
